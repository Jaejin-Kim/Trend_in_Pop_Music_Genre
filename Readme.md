# Research Question

Weâ€™ve all heard of the Jazz Age, when Jazz music and dancing gained nationwide popularity in the US, reflecting unprecedented economic growth and political development of the time. There is also the hippie movement in the 60s and 70s, when psychedelic rock became hugely popular following the outbreak of the Vietnam war, civil rights movement, and the spread of psychedelic drugs. However, we do not hear too much about what happened in the musical trends during the time of, for example, economic depression. Is it true that socio-economic state of a country affects the musical trends, or are musical historians making unwarranted claims? If it is true, in a time when we hear more and more about faltering economic conditions and increasing conflicts both internationally and internationally, would angrier or gloomier music gain more popularity?
